gray library
============

The gray library is a collection of simple, yet hopefully useful utility modules.

The gray library includes these modules:

  list.o - a generic linked list manager
  grid.o - a generic grid(matrix/spreadsheet) manager
  grid-size.o - a grid size object structure that accompanies grid.o
  grid-api.o - a more full featured single function command based wrapper
               around grid.o
  grid-xml.o - an XML import/export module for grid.o
  color.o - a simple RGBA color object structure
  color-xml.o - an XML import/export module for color.o
  vertex.o - a simple 3D vertex object structure
  vertex-xml.o - an XML import/export module for vertex.o
  vertices.o - a list of vertex manager
  vertices-xml.o - an XML import/export module for vertices.o
  xml-extensions.o - extensions to the libxml2 library
  strapp.o - a string append function to supplement the ubiquitous str* functions
  sieve.o - helper functions for creating an input stream sieve using a
            doc-list.
  reference.o - a simple per user persistent object reference counter
  doc-list.o - a filtering function that can divide any STDIO input stream into
               separate text documents based on a regular expression and mark
               a subset of these documents for easy processing later.

The gray library is used by the blue library and possibly other packages.

Also, a complete set of user guide, tutorial, manpages, and reference manual
can be built and installed from these sources.
